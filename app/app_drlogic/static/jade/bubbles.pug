				'Insanity Artists was established in 2003 and has become the UKs largest live agency exclusively representing DJ and PA talent from the areas of music, fashion, television and radio. Their clients include: Shayne Ward, Sarah Harding, Gareth Gates & 5ive.',
				'At Insanity, we use Macs pretty much across the board to run our business.  Our clients have high expectations and when you’re working internationally, you can’t afford to have email go down, or a laptop out of action – it could mean losing a vital booking – or worse a client.',
				'We’d had a support company on a contract before, but we weren’t getting what we needed, so we approached Dr Logic.',
				'From the beginning, it was a different approach.  The team came in and took the time to really understand our set-up and where we were having issues.  They got a support contract up and running really quickly and picked up on a few things we hadn’t thought of doing.  Sounds simple, but it’s made a big difference to how our IT runs.  Day-to-day, when there’s a problem – it just gets sorted.',
				'Someone’s on site regularly, so they tend to spot issues before they happen. And we know that as our business grows and we need to upgrade, Dr Logic will work with us.',
				'It’s better than my own Doctor!'

It is this unique combination of hardware and software as a holistic ecosystem that makes them perfect for growing international businesses such as ourselves.'
