						p In 1986, Dr Logic got his hands on his first Mac and so began a lifelong obsession with Apple. In 2003 he started Dr Logic and over time, gathered together like-minded techies who wanted to do cool stuff with IT.
						p Dr Logic has built a reputation for helping creative companies with all things Mac-related. And for being that little bit different. We’re based in Clerkenwell and we support companies across London.
